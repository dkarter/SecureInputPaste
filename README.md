An Alfred Workflow allowing paste into secure input fields. Because life is too
short to type out long complicated passwords.

## Usage

When a secure input field appears (e.g. account password prompt when opening
keychain):

1. Invoke Alfred
2. Start typing `secu` and you will see three options for pasting your clipboard
   by fake typing the contents into the password field.
